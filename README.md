ðŸš¦ Traffic Signal E-challan System:

Tech Stack / Hardware: Arduino IDE, ESP32-CAM, Ultrasonic Sensor, FTDI Programmer

Description:

* Designed and implemented a smart traffic monitoring system to capture vehicle registration numbers of vehicles violating traffic signals for automated penalty processing (e-challan generation).
* Utilized ESP32-CAM module for real-time image capture and Ultrasonic Sensor to detect vehicles crossing the stop line during a red or yellow signal.
* Programmed using Arduino IDE, with data output displayed on the Serial Monitor for further analysis or penalty issuance.
* FTDI Programmer used for uploading code to the ESP32-CAM module.

Key Features / Highlights:

* Automated violation detection based on traffic signal states and vehicle movement.
* Image capture of violating vehicles for record-keeping and enforcement.
* Low-cost IoT setup suitable for real-world deployment at intersections.
* Real-time monitoring via Serial Output Display.
